Hey Plasticity group :smile:! 

For today's team meeting I will talk about multivariate pattern analysis,
and more in general give you a little introduction to machine learning "jargon" and steps in a pipeline. To do so, I will present some slides and use a web application that I prepared for this meeting. The application is organized in sections, each related to a specific point in the presentation as indicated in the slides by this symbol -> :space_invader:

With the limited presentation time (approx. 45 min / 1 hour) it's gonna be difficult to really enter into details of everything surrounding classifiers and their parameters, but my hope by the end of the session is that the vocabulary surrounding machine learning methods in neuroimaging will become a bit more clear to you. 

In this application you can generate some data and try out for yourself different classifiers commonly used in multivariate pattern analysis in neuroimaging. I highly encourage you to try out different data generation processes as well as different classifier parameters, to visually see how these decisions can have an impact on the final results! The link to the application is public and will remain online, so you can come back to this link whenever you want to if you wish to do so. 

I hope you enjoy, thank you very much for your attention!
