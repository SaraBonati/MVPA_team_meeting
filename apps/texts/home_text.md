## Team meeting 19/11/2021

Hey Plasticity group :smile:! 

For today's team meeting I will talk about multivariate pattern analysis, something we are using in the FLEX study,
and more in general give you a little introduction to machine learning "jargon" and common methods in supervised and 
unsupervised learning. To do so, I will present some slides and use an application that I prepared for this meeting that you will find 
by clicking the tab "Machine Learning 101" on the left side of the screen.

With the limited presentation time (approx. 1 hour) it's gonna be difficult to really enter into details of everything surrounding classifiers and their parameters, but my hope by the end of the session is that the vocabulary surrounding machine learning methods in neuroimaging will become a bit more clear to you. 

In this application you can generate some data and try out for yourself different classifiers
commonly used in multivariate pattern analysis in neuroimaging. I highly encourage you to try out different data generation processes as well as different classifier parameters, to visually see how these decisions can have an impact on the final results! The link to the application is public and will remain online, so you can come back to this link whenever you want to if you wish to do so 

I hope you enjoy, thank you very much for your attention!

## Where can I learn more about ?
