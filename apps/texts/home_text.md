Hey Plasticity group :smile:! 

For today's team meeting I will talk about multivariate pattern analysis,
and more in general give you a little introduction to machine learning "jargon" and steps in a pipeline. To do so, I will present some slides and use a web application that I prepared for this meeting. The application is organized in sections, each related to a specific point in the presentation as indicated in the slides by this symbol -> :space_invader:

In this application we can generate some data and try out different classifiers commonly used in multivariate pattern analysis in neuroimaging. Let's try out different data generation processes as well as different classifier parameters, to visually see how these decisions can have an impact on the final results! 

I hope you enjoy, thank you very much for your attention!
